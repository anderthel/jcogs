# Jcogs

A propably broken set of cogs for [Red Discord Bot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot)
Fair warning when using any of them that I am only just learning to code and as such I would not advise using these cogs.

## Installation
Use the downloader cog to add the repo and install your chosen cog
```
[p]repo add <repo-name> <repo_url>
[p]cog install <repo-name> <cogs...>
```

## Commands:
Your on your own figuring out how the cogs work until I get around to updating this
